# Purpose of the app

This app allows users to create, view, update, cross off and delete activities in their bucket list. A user can only view his/her bucket list activities, but not other users' activities.

How the app works:

 1. Sign up with fake email and password
 2. Sign in with created email and password
 3. Change password
 4. Display bucket list activities
 5. Create a bucket list activity
 6. Update a bucket list activity
 7. Cross off a bucket list activity once completed
 8. Sign out

# Planning, Process and Problem Solving

At the beginning the team reached an agreement that first priority was was to work on the back end: API and database components. Then the goal was to set up the skeleton for the front-end and make sure all the auth and crud functions were working on both the front and back end.

The scrum framework enabled just-in-time planning and ensured consistent progress towards end goals. Andre was scrum master. Anna was product owner. Jordan and Dave were developers. All the team members contributed code on the front and back end. The biggest challenge was incorporating everyone's contributions into github and resolving conflicts. Given the three day timeframe time management was of utmost importance.

Screen sharing (with a projector and google hangouts) proved to be very helpful for problem solving. Working as a team towards finding a solution sped up successful completion for project tasks.

# Unresolved Issues

Messaging at the top of the page makes it seem like there is no messaging if one scrolls down, for instance when deleting or updating items on one's list.
